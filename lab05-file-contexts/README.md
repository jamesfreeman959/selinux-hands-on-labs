# Filesystem contexts

Our application never switched contexts on execution because we didn't actually change the context on the file itself. Now there are two ways to do this.

The first is to use the **chcon** command - you would set the context of our binary like this:

```
[james@selinux-dev selinux-hands-on-labs]$ sudo chcon -t testprog_exec_t /usr/bin/testprog
[james@selinux-dev selinux-hands-on-labs]$ ls -lZ /usr/bin/testprog
-rwxr-xr-x. root root unconfined_u:object_r:testprog_exec_t:s0 /usr/bin/testprog
```

Initially this looks good - however there is something to be aware of, and that is filesystem relabelling, or context restoring. A full relabel of a filesystem should be a rare occurrence, but you cannot prevent another system administrator unknowingly coming along and restoring the context of all the files in a directory to their defaults. They might do this in a well-meaning effort to fix another problem, or as part of a policy enforcement - either way we have seen in previous labs that the default context of the files in `/usr/bin` is not `testprog_exec_t`:

```
[james@selinux-dev selinux-hands-on-labs]$ ls -ldZ /usr/bin
dr-xr-xr-x. root root system_u:object_r:bin_t:s0       /usr/bin
[james@selinux-dev selinux-hands-on-labs]$ ls -lZ /usr/bin/testprog
-rwxr-xr-x. root root unconfined_u:object_r:testprog_exec_t:s0 /usr/bin/testprog
[james@selinux-dev selinux-hands-on-labs]$ sudo restorecon -v /usr/bin/*
restorecon reset /usr/bin/testprog context unconfined_u:object_r:testprog_exec_t:s0->unconfined_u:object_r:bin_t:s0
```

Obviously if this were to happen on a live server it would break your application the next time it was launched - clearly not good. As a result, we must declare the file context as part of the policy we have created. In addition to the `testprog.te` file which remains unchanged in this lab, we now introduce `testprog.fc`:

```
[james@selinux-dev lab05-file-contexts]$ cat testprog.fc
/usr/bin/testprog	-- system_u:object_r:testprog_exec_t:s0
```

Now we rebuild the policy as in the previous lab and install it:

```
[james@selinux-dev lab05-file-contexts]$ make -f /usr/share/selinux/devel/Makefile testprog.pp
Compiling targeted testprog module
/usr/bin/checkmodule:  loading policy configuration from tmp/testprog.tmp
/usr/bin/checkmodule:  policy configuration loaded
/usr/bin/checkmodule:  writing binary representation (version 17) to tmp/testprog.mod
Creating targeted testprog.pp policy package
rm tmp/testprog.mod tmp/testprog.mod.fc
[james@selinux-dev lab05-file-contexts]$ sudo semodule -r testprog
libsemanage.semanage_direct_remove_key: Removing last testprog module (no other testprog module exists at another priority).
[james@selinux-dev lab05-file-contexts]$ sudo semodule -i testprog.pp
```

Normally you wouldn't need to remove the old module first, but we are being lazy here and haven't bumped up the version number in the head of the policy file, so we are taking this opportunity to demonstrate the removal and installation of a module.

We should now have a default context installed for our binary file - let's test it:

```
[james@selinux-dev lab05-file-contexts]$ sudo restorecon -v /usr/bin/*
restorecon reset /usr/bin/testprog context unconfined_u:object_r:bin_t:s0->unconfined_u:object_r:testprog_exec_t:s0
```

Excellent! What happens now if we run the binary from the shell?

```
[james@selinux-dev lab05-file-contexts]$ sudo /usr/bin/testprog /etc/testprog.conf /var/run/testprog.pid &
[1] 12441
[1]+  Segmentation fault      sudo /usr/bin/testprog /etc/testprog.conf /var/run/testprog.pid
```

Excellent!! You may be wondering why it is excellent that we have broken our application and received a `Segmentation Fault`, but this actually is an indication that we have switched contexts and are no longer operating in the **unconfined** context but instead one that is totally restricted. 

The next lab will focus on confirming this so we can do something about it.
